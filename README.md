# Introduction

This project was to determine how effective a neural network would be in classifying whether or not an image was a Monet or not. Final results was the creation of a model that could correctly pick if an image was a Monet or not roughly 85%   of the time.

## Data

Images used were a selection of images from Kaggle's [Painter by Numbers](https://www.kaggle.com/c/painter-by-numbers)
